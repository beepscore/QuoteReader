Open Android Studio import project from Eclipse.
Android Studio will change directory structure slightly.
Don't open Eclipse and export project + gradle. That would keep Eclipse's directory structure.

Android Studio generated file import-summary.txt
Android Studio warns import failure, project needs some Android Extras.
However, app installs and runs on Nexus 4 device.
I restarted Android Studio and don't see the warning.
Gradle sync may have been able to download dependencies and fix it.
